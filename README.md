# APiP-Project
Advanced Programming with Python - Project

## Dependencies

All Python dependencies are in the `requirements.txt` file. And outside of that we use [Deta](https://github.com/deta) as our cloud server for the app.

## Prerequisites

Before starting work on the project you must install all needed dependencies:

```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt
```

Moreover probably will need to setup .env file in the project root with PROJECT_KEY for Deta to work accordingly. For that contact @lswarss
