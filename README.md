## Dependencies

All Python dependencies are in the `requirements.txt` file. And outside of that we use [Deta](https://github.com/deta) as our cloud server for the app.

## Prerequisites

Before starting work on the project you must install all needed dependencies:

```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt
```

Moreover probably will need to setup .env file in the project root with PROJECT_KEY for Deta to work accordingly. For that contact @lswarss

## Swagger UI Documentation

## How to Deploy 

Deployment of the app is made with [Docker Registry](https://hub.docker.com/repository/docker/lswarss/shrekit/general) and DigitialOcean App Platform. And to trigger deployment you must:

- Add new release tag on Github with pattern: v*
- Or merge pull request to main branch

Those actions will trigger [deployment pipeline](https://github.com/VerticalHeretic/APiP-Project/actions/workflows/docker-image.yml) and create new build in registry + deploy it to DigitialOcean.
